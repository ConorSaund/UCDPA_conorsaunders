## Abstract
In this project, the analysis was of pricing of Airbnb listings in ten European capital cities. The dataset consisted of twenty files, including weekday and weekend data for each city. The aim was to gain insights into the factors affecting the pricing of Airbnb listings in these cities.

##Introduction
The various attributes in the dataset, such as pricing, satisfaction levels, and location to a metro, provide a rich source of information that can be used to extract insights. Working with this dataset requires creative thinking and the application of various analytical techniques to derive meaningful results. We all know the reasons that causes rental spaces to increase their pricing, it is interesting to try to prove it with certain factors.

##Dataset
The dataset used was of Airbnb pricing in ten European capital cities. The attributes used in the data sets were room types, cleanliness, distance from the city center to name a few. The data sets consist of weekday data and weekend data for the ten cities, leading to twenty files to work with. There were approximately 51700 observations of non-null entries.

The dataset was chosen as it provides an interesting opportunity to analyse the Airbnb market in some of the most popular European tourist destinations. The dataset was also accredited by the National Science centre in Poland under project 2017/27/N/HS4/00951. By examining the pricing trends and characteristics of Airbnb listings in these cities we can gain insights into the broader tourism sector, and with further analysis it could be used to identity futures areas of growth.
