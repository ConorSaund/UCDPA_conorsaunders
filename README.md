##Abstract
(Short overview of the entire project and features)

##Introduction
I thought that this set of data was ideal as it allowed for manipulation of the datasets and working with large datasets. It is not your typical type of data and forces you to think outside of the box when trying to calculate your insights.

##Dataset
The dataset used was of Airbnb pricing in ten European capital cities. The attributes used in the data sets were room types, cleanliness, distance from the city center to name a few. The data sets consist of weekday data and weekend data for the ten cities, leading to twenty files to work with.
